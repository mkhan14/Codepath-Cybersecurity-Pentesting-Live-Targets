# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Instead of entering a salesperson's id number, an attacker can inject an sql command into the url:
```id=%27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27```

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Give the logged-in session ID to the other browser so that it has access to the staff area.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
<img src="week9enumeration.gif" width="800">
The failed login message for a username that exists differs from that of a username that doesn't exist. From the browser's "inspect element" tool, I found that for the username that exists, an unsuccessful login attempt will make the message bold and put inside the class "failure" whereas an unsuccessful login attempt with a username that doesn't exist will not make the message bold and will put the message inside the class "failed".

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
<img src="week9xss.gif" width="800">
An attacker can inject an XSS in the feedback form in the Contact page, which runs when the user opens the Feedback page after logging in:
```<script>alert('Mahin found the XSS!");</script>```


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
<img src="week9idor.gif" width="800">
An attacker can access the information about a salesperson that isn't visible on the list by changing the id to 10 or 11 in the url. If the attacker tries to do this on the differently colored sites, the attacker is redirected.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
